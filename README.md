## Built With

built with based on orginal vanilla windows 11 latest from microsoft

https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

## Getting Started

HOW TO INSTALL THE CUSTOM OS ?

### Prerequisites

1)ZOHO WINDOWS ISO
2)PENDRIVE (4GB MIN)
3)BACKUP EVERYTHING ON YOUR HARD DISK 


### Installation

Create Windows Installation media. If you order Windows 10 for a new PC build, they may send you an installation media. If you don't have a Windows installation media, you can make one. You'll need a computer with internet access and an 8 GB USB flash drive (16 GB recommended). You also need to know if the computer you want to install Windows 11 on has 32-bit or 64-bit architecture. You will also need to purchase Windows to get a product key. This can be done before or after the installation. Use the following steps to create a Windows Installation Media:[1]
Insert a USB drive with at least 8 GB of space into any computer with internet access. This will wipe any existing data on the USB drive, so be sure to back up any data you want to keep.
Go to http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=616447 in a web browser.
Click Download Tool Now.
Open the "MediaCreationTool.exe" file in your web browser or Downloads folder.
Click Accept.
Select "Create Installation Media (USB drive, DVD, ISO file) for another PC" and click Next.
Select your language, Windows edition, and PC architecture and click Next.
Select "USB flash drive" and click Next.
Select your USB drive and click Next.



Boot the computer. If the PC is already powered on, restart it using the normal restart procedures of the operating system that is installed on the PC. If it is not yet powered on, press the power button to boot it up.


Enter the Boot menu. Most newer computers have a boot menu you can enter while booting up. The way you enter it is different, depending on your motherboard. The most common way to enter the Boot menu is to press F10, F11, F12, F2, or Esc as the PC boots up. This Boot menu will display a list of drives you can boot from.[4]
If you are using an older PC that does not have a Boot menu, you will need to Enter the BIOS while booting up. The buttons you press to enter the BIOS is different from one PC manufacturer to another. It will usually say what buttons you need to press while your computer boots up. You typically need to press F1 F2, F3, Esc or Delete to enter the BIOS.[5] You may need to be quick about it. You can also reboot your PC into the BIOS from inside the Windows Settings menu.


Select the USB drive. This is the drive that has the Windows Installation Media. This will boot the PC from the Windows Installation Media. Once the computer boots from the USB drive, press any key to start the Windows installation process.
If you are inside the BIOS settings. Locate the option that says "Boot", "Boot order", "Priorities" or something similar. Change the boot order so that your PC boots from the USB drive first. Then select the option to save and exit. This will reboot your PC from the USB drive.


THATS IT :)
